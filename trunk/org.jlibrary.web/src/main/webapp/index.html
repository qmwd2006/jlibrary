			<h2>About jLibrary demo</h2>
			<p>This demo shows a dynamic web application developed with jLibrary. You will be able to connect to the demo repository 
			 	 through the web application and browse it, modify it, search it, download content or even obtain RSS feeds to be 
			 	 notified about updates in the repository content.</p>
			<p>By default you will be connected to the repository with a guest user so you do not need to log in to 
			 	 work with the demo. However, you can user the following preconfigured users: <span>reader/reader</span> that only has 
			 	 reader permissions (effectively will behave as the guest user) and <span>editor/editor</span> that has editor 
			 	 permissions.</p>
			<p>The special thing about this demo is that you can also connect to the demo repository from your <span>jLibrary desktop 
		   	 application</span> using the url <span><i>http://www.jlibrary.org/demo</i></span>. You can use the same login 
		   	 information and work from your desktop and the changes will be immediately visible from the web application!</p>
		   
			<p>We really hope you like this demo. Should you have any suggestions or feedback send it to 
				 <A href="mailto:demo@jlibrary.org">our email</A>.</p>
