			<h2>About jLibrary demo</h2>
			<p>This demo shows a dynamic web application developed with jLibrary. You will be able to connect to the demo repository 
			 	 through the web application and browse it, modify it, search it, download content or even obtain RSS feeds to be 
			 	 notified about updates in the repository content.</p>
			<p>The special thing about this demo is that you can also connect to the demo repository from your <span>jLibrary desktop 
		   	 application</span> using the url <span><i>http://demo.jlibrary.org</i></span>. You can use the same login 
		   	 information and work from your desktop and the changes will be immediately visible from the web application!</p>

			<p>This demo is really simple. It does not pretend to be a jLibrary web clone but just a simple application that seves as 
			   proof of concept and that hopefully it will bring you some ideas. Therefore, many of the of the features available in the 
			   desktop application are not available in this web demo, but do not be afraid, there is still plenty of things to play with 
			   on this web application!</p>
			<p>We have set up several users to make the task of working with jLibrary really easy. Just click on the demo link below 
                        and you will find all the information.</p>
		   
			<p>We really hope you like this demo. Should you have any suggestions or feedback send it to 
				 <a href="mailto:demo@jlibrary.org">our email</a>.</p>
