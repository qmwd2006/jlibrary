		<p><b>Congratulations!</b> You have successfully installed the <b>jLibrary server</b> and now you are ready to enjoy this Open Source Document Management System. jLibrary help pages are on the web, so if you need to learn about how to use jLibrary then click on the upper-left jLibrary title or simply go to <A href="http://www.jlibrary.org">http://www.jlibrary.org</A>.</p>

<p>If you have any problem then browse the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=331944">users</A> and <A href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=331945">developers</A> forums as they already contain loads of informationa about possible issues, optimizations,
tips and tricks. Feel free also to join the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jlibrary-developers">jLibrary mailing list</A> in which you will also find help or where you can share all your suggestions and ideas.</p>

<p>If you need help using the client tool keep and eye on the <A href="http://www.jlibrary.org/repositories/jLibrary/Tutorials">tutorials</A> and <A href="http://www.jlibrary.org/repositories/jLibrary/Articles">articles</A> sections, and on all the other information available at the website.

<h2>Support and licensing</h2>
<p>jLibrary is <A href="http://www.jlibrary.org/repositories/jLibrary/License">licensed</A> under the BSD license. This means that you can freely use and modify the tool either for commercial or non commercial purposes just only maintaining some copyright notices.</p>
<p>However, jLibrary team is open to any kind of collaboration, deal proposition or even to offer commercial support. So, if you are interested in the project and you want to make some deal just send a message to <A href="mailto:martin@jlibrary.org">this address</A>.

<h2>Want to contribute?</h2>
<p>jLibrary is open to contributions. This jLibrary server can be a great platform to develop new applications on top of it. Currently there are plans to develop several proof-of-concept applications using cool technologies like Grails, Ruby on Rails, Java Server Faces, Wicket, RSS, or even Amazon Web Services stack. Using jLibrary for testing things is by far much more easier than developing all your persistence layer.</p>
<p>So if you have any idea to implement, or if you only really want to join the development team to improve the server or client code, then just send a message to <A href="mailto:martin@jlibrary.org">this address</A>.
